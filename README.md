Imagine you’re a data scientist of an alcohol store (Cheers Alcohol) and your company is going to enter the market of Iowa. You are asked to design a go-to-market strategy based on the data you have. You need to suggest:<br>
1.If Cheers Alcohol wants to launch 3 stores, which county/counties should you target?<br>
2.To predict the total sales for the county/counties you selected to launch stores in each month of 2021<br>
3.What items would you sell in each store?  Select top 10 items in each store to promote<br>
And any other suggestions you will give for your go-to-market strategy after getting some insights from the data
